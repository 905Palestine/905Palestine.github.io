description: The Niagara Palestine Coalition (NPC) strengthens its mission through strategic networking that unites diverse groups in solidarity with the Palestinian cause. Our approach includes forming alliances with like-minded organizations, engaging with local and international decision-makers to influence policy, leveraging social media for outreach, participating in public events for advocacy, hosting educational programs, and establishing community support networks. By connecting with a wide range of partners, the NPC amplifies its voice and works towards justice and human rights for Palestinians within the Niagara Region and beyond.
