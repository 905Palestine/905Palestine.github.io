title: Influence
description: The Niagara Palestine Coalition (NPC) influences its community by fostering awareness, understanding, and solidarity with the Palestinian people through education, advocacy, and grassroots activism. Their efforts include organizing educational events to inform the public, participating in policy discussions to influence local government actions, collaborating with other organizations for broader impact, and providing support networks for Palestinians living in Niagara. By engaging in public discourse, countering discrimination, and leveraging social media campaigns, the NPC shapes both local attitudes and regional policies towards a more inclusive stance on Palestinian rights.
